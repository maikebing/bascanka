**Bascanka** is a free and open-source large file text editor for Windows designed as a modern, lightweight alternative to traditional editors. It supports a wide range of programming and markup languages and is distributed under the GNU General Public License Version 3.

UI and text rendering engine are built entirely from scratch in **C#** on **.NET 10**, Bascanka is engineered for performance, portability, and simplicity. It runs as a single self-contained executable with no third-party dependencies - just copy and run. Its architecture is optimized for responsiveness even when working with extremely large files, including datasets and logs in the multi-gigabyte range (**10 GB and beyond**).

Bascanka focuses on efficient resource usage and fast text processing while maintaining a clean, practical editing experience. By minimizing overhead and avoiding unnecessary dependencies, it delivers high performance with a small footprint - making it suitable for both everyday editing and demanding large-file workloads.

### 📦 Bascanka v.1.0.3

#### Release notes

v.1.0.3.		2025-02-18
--------------------------
- implemented embedded terminal (cmd.exe) to the bottom panel using the Windows ConPTY API.
- added close/crash unsaved changes recovery with periodic automatic back-ups to "%AppData%\Bascanka\recovery" - small/untitled files are backed up in full size as UTF-8, while large memory-mapped files use efficient binary delta/changes-only save format.
- fixed emoji and special character rendering, cursor positioning, selection, and caret navigation - including surrogate pairs, ZWJ sequences and variation selectors.
- lines containing wide or special characters are now rendered character-by-character to prevent GDI font fallback from causing cursor drift.
- improved Unicode character support.
- implemented a pending-delta mechanism for the line offset cache — consecutive same-line edits accumulate a virtual shift in O(1) instead of triggering an O(N) full-document rescan.
- added double-click on empty tab bar area to create a new untitled document.
- added tabbed bottom panel - Find Results and Terminal now share a tabbed bottom panel.
- fixed search history not being saved correctly.
- added Modern Windows Context Menu registration from Settings ("Edit with Bascanka"), with automatic sparse package and COM shell extension setup.
- only one Bascanka instance now runs at a time - opening files while it's running forwards them to the existing window via named pipes.

## About the Name

The name "Bascanka" comes from the [Bašćanska ploča](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%C5%A1%C4%87anska_plo%C4%8Da) (Baska tablet) - a stone tablet from around 1100 AD, found in the Church of St. Lucy near Baska on the island of Krk, Croatia. It is one of the oldest known inscriptions in the Croatian language, written in Glagolitic script. The tablet documents a royal land donation by King Zvonimir and is a cornerstone of Croatian cultural heritage and literacy.
